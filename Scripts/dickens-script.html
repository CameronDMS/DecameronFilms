    <h1>Clean Your Room, Bucko</h1>
    <p><em>(Short Story)</em></p>

    <p>In the upper floor room of a student-house, in the worst area of Kingston; where one would party in the lower floors, filling them with the husks of liquor, and carry the corpses of fast food to bed: there lay, spread across a mattress without a frame or covers, an unwashed man with messy hair, who in response to the sudden sound of his alarm, reached out a bony hand to silence the afternoon. So much garbage was strewn across the table that items from disparate corners of life began to mix: weed occupied the cover of an unread copy of Leaves of Grass, Oxycotton lay scattered besides an empty package of natural almonds, and a bottle of salt had tipped sideways, spilling into an open bottle on the floor: the evidence of many nights spent alone.</p>

    <p>Although the alarm could be silenced, the sound of construction outside could not, and so Oliver reluctantly rose to the call of late afternoon. Rising from the wrong side of the bed, Oliver became conscious of an awful parched throat, and in his groggy effort to find relief he narrowly avoided stepping on a pile of broken glass, before picking up a bottle on the floor. Whether or not Oliver was experimenting with a new morning routine, in which one benefits from the curative effects of salt water, or suffering from a diminished capacity for critical judgement wrought upon him by his poor habits, is a matter open to discussion. Whatever was the cause, the unexpected assault to his tastebuds caused such a shock that Oliver dropped the bottle on his foot. The pain of this compounded with the shock to make him stumble backwards and nearly place his foot on the broken glass for a second time before he fell on the bed. Here the familiar embrace of his mattress soothed the pain and guided him back into a deep sleep.</p>

    <p>On the other side of town, in a room far cleaner than Oliver’s, a boy was polishing a pair of glasses as if his life depended on it, with a silk cloth. Looks of exasperation were given and proclamations of a frustrated sort made at the air as a particularly obstinate speck clung to the glass. He would stop every now and then to hold the pair up and inspect it in the light, and when satisfied that the speck had been defeated, place it gently on the table and move on to the next pair. So deep in concentration was he that he hadn’t heard the footsteps of his friend come down the stairs, or his announcement, and it was only his name being called that elicited a response. Will turned in shock to find his friend grinning widely with a stack of books in his arms.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, having recovered from the cruelty of the decisions we are prone to make when in that state in between consciousness and unconsciousness, Oliver had thrown on first articles of clothing in sight and now stood in front of his reflected image, where the messiness of his hair, the large stain on his backwards shirt, and the patchy, unshaven stubble on his face were things he did not care to fix before getting on with the day. Lazily grabbing his bag, which was full of papers and other stuff, he had to shove and bend it to get it in. While making room for the notebook, he felt a piece of a chocolate bar, and after a moment of inspection during which Oliver deemed the chocolate chunk inedible, he carelessly threw it back into his bag. Whether or not the smudges a melted chocolate bar may make on the white bottom of a notebook occurred to him is unlikely, but it is equally unlikely that he would have cared if it had.</p>

    <p>Over at Will’s house, after Earl had placed the books on the table, by Will’s orders the two were not allowed to look at them until they had been painstakingly lined up one beside the other and straightened multiple times. Earl was seated while Will did this, his excitement rapidly shifting into regret, when Will finished.</p>

    <p>“Done! Now isn’t that much better than dumping them on the table.“ said Will.</p>

    <p>“Sure.” said Earl, and seeing the books lined up, some of his former excitement returned to him. “Fresh as can be, and definitely worth more than I got them for.”</p>

    <p>“Fantastic, really, quite fantastic.” replied Will, putting on his glasses and inspecting the cover of one closely.</p>

    <p>“And then there’s this, the main attraction…” said Earl, remembering the original surprise that he intended, and slowly removing a book from under the table for dramatic effect.</p>

    <p>“Careful with it!” said Will, who instinctively reached for the book as if he were the only one qualified to handle such a valuable object, and taking it from Earl’s hands. Turning the book over in his hands, he heard the sound of another set of footsteps approaching.</p>

    <p>“Sorry I’m late.” Oliver said, throwing his bag by the stairs. “Damn alarm never went off.”</p>

    <p>“Hello, Oliver.” Will replied, coldly, while staring at the stain on Oliver’s shirt.</p>

    <p>“Hi. Now Earl, are you going to show me this thing or not?” said Oliver, moving towards the table.</p>

    <p>Will, having seen the stains on his shirt, had a sense of the cleanliness of his person, and thus the validity of his character and finally, to him, the value of his mind.</p>

    <p>“No!” said Will, tearing away the big blue book he was still protectively cradling away from the outstretched arms of Oliver.</p>

    <p>“Relax.” said Earl, embarrassed at his friend’s animosity. “Oliver, which one do you want to see?”</p>

    <p>“That one looks cool!” Oliver said, pointing to the big, blue covered book. “I’d like to read that one!”</p>

    <p>Will snorted at this, and Earl, having himself experienced Will’s infantilizing treatment and now seeing it directed towards his friend, decided to take some satisfaction in annoying him.</p>

    <p>“Would you want to bring it home?” asked Earl.</p>

    <p>“Why, sure!” replied Oliver.</p>

    <p>There was a goodness to the offer, as Earl really did want to give Oliver the opportunity to partake in their hobby, for his own good, but it would be incorrect to say that Earl did not watch Will’s dumbfounded astonishment with satisfaction as Oliver pried the book from his hands. And so it was that Oliver left as quickly as he had entered in the excitement of finally being included in something.</p>

    <p>“Shall I order another copy?” asked Will, pulling out his laptop and placing it on the table. “You’re paying for it.”</p>

    <p>“You don’t think he’ll bring it back?” inquired Earl.</p>

    <p>“Bring it back! Why, I don’t see why he wouldn’t. The only question is the condition it will return in.” said Will.</p>

    <p>“What condition would that be?” asked Earl.</p>

    <p>The general animosity Will felt towards Oliver was, in that moment, rendered stronger by Earl’s casualness in letting him partake in their hobby.</p>

    <p>“Are you kidding me?” said Will, slamming the laptop closed. “Did you see the stain on his shirt? The kid has not the slightest idea of personal property in his head, is careless towards the clothes on his back, and can barely keep the stubble off of his face. He will return home, and if he has not outright lost the thing on the way, will place it in some pile of filth. If ever that book is read again, I’ll buy the next twenty.” Having said this, he rose from his chair and began wiping the table where Oliver had sat with a cloth.</p>

    <p>Crossing the streets with an uprightness not typically observed in the young man, Oliver held the book tightly under his arms, as if it had such value that even the sunlight could diminish the lustre of its cover. But with all things that we place such value on, we must weather whether the environment they are being brought to is in the right condition for their survival. No matter how excited we are to finally be given the chance to take on some responsibility, nothing can be cared for when you do not care for yourself.</p>

    <p>Upon arriving home, Oliver sprinted up the stairs, eager to begin reading. There, on that little chair that looked out upon a shattered window, he passed the day engaged with the book, until night descended. At the same time, although in quite a different environment, Will was partaking in a similar activity. The two men were not as dissimilar as we might assume. Yawning, Oliver set the book down on the floor, but seeing it as just another object in that chaotic pile gave him pause. He could not bear to see it in that position, the thought of it getting dirty tormenting him, and so picked it up and went to the table. The table being full almost thwarted his attempt, but another moment of reflection and it occurred to him to clear it off, and so he placed the empty coffee cups that had lain on the table on top of his own laptop, and let it rest in the clearing, all throughout the night.</p>

    <p>When morning broke, the first thing Oliver did was check to make sure the book was in its proper condition, as if somehow just by being on that table it was susceptible to contamination. Heaving a sigh of relief, he carefully lowered it into his backpack, and excited to discuss the contents with Earl and prove Will a fool, sprinted down the stairs.</p>

    <p>The two men were seated on opposite sides of the table in Will’s basement. Ethan was reading one of the new books and whistling softly to himself as he turned the pages, while Will, being overcome with anxiety that Oliver’s absence was due to some mishap with the book, had his hands engaged with one another in an earnest fidgeting match, and his eyes alternating between his friend’s calm face and the clock as each minute ticked past slower than the last. To this state the recognizable shuffle was heard, and before Oliver had even entered, Will was halfway over the back of the couch in anticipation.</p>

    <p>“Do you have it?” he asked, as soon as Oliver was in sight.</p>

    <p>Taken aback, Oliver looked puzzled, and Will took this as a sign of him backing down from the question.</p>

    <p>“You don’t have it, do you?” Will said.</p>

    <p>“Have what?” Oliver asked.</p>

    <p>“The book!” responded Will, smiting the cushion of the couch with his fist.</p>

    <p>“Oh! Why didn’t you say so. It’s right here.” he said, opening his bag. He began to pull the book out triumphantly, when looking in he paused and Will watched as Oliver’s face went pale.</p>

    <p>“Is it there?” he asked.</p>

    <p>Oliver stared dumbly at the open bag. Vaulting over the couch, Will shoved Oliver away, and looked inside for himself. The same shocked expression that had crossed Oliver’s face now crossed his, but this quickly turned into a look of anger, as he removed the book from the bag and held it in the air for all to see.</p>

    <p>“See! I told you he couldn’t be trusted!” he exclaimed, thrusting it in the direction of Earl.</p>

    <p>The book, having occupied the same place within Oliver’s bag as the chocolate bar he had thrown in carelessly the other day, now had a brown spot smeared across its edges. Earl looked at the book, and shook his head.</p>

    <p>“Get out of here!” yelled Will.</p>

    <p>Oliver, the words failing in his mouth, gave one last pleading look to Earl, who felt the eyes of Oliver’s pleading look, and averting them, only shook his head slowly at the book and pointed to the door. Oliver, about to make a scene, looked at what he had done to the book, and a wave of shame descended upon him. Without any further fight, he turned and left.</p>

    <p>Facing the street, Oliver was still in shock when the wind blew a piece of trash by his foot. The expression on his face turned from self-pity to determination, and he picked it up.</p>
